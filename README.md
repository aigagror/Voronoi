# Voronoi
You must have Xcode to run this program.
In the main.cpp file:
  Please fix the full path string on line 35 if you download this. 
  Feel free to modify the macros POINTILLISM and NUM_CNTRS:
    POINTILLISM can be 0 or 1 indicating whether you want the picture to be pointillistic or a voronoi diagram
      Please make NUM_CNTRS small if you set it to 0 as it will take a LONG time to process (O(n^2) time)
    NUM_CNTRS indicates how many 'points' your want
